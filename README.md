I will going to use this features for my clients for the same basic plans. and offer them that they can also now go for email marketing with the basic plan as well,   now client can use any email marketing software..   this features is only for rediretions to the main sites,, however I recommend both the option lets, say user don't want put real email id, but and he don't have access to the mail he put at the same time he will be redirected to the destination site,   and landing page owner can also generate leads, and can do automation in the background


YOu will see the first line , var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true);
find and match teh code for mailchimp form code only then after this paste the code which you find the codes on the netlify folder of this repository.
if your client giving you different company form like convertkit the after gettting its html code try using chatgpt to turn that form code into oredirecting machine for serverless serverl iike netlify.
